**`Software Developer (Web Development | Machine Learning)`**

I'm a software developer focusing in web development and machine learning. I am currently a university student looking for internship opportunities in this field. I try to work on projects that reflect good skills and development in my porgramming experience. Along side my tutoring position at my school, I started a YouTube channel "[Devin the Developer][youtube]", which I am uploading tutorials to assist other students in their journey.
